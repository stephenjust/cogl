/**
 * SECTION:cogl-gst-video-sink
 * @short_description: A video sink for integrating a GStreamer
 *   pipeline with a Cogl pipeline.
 *
 * #CoglGstVideoSink is a subclass of #GstBaseSink which can be used to
 * create a #CoglPipeline for rendering the frames of the video.
 *
 * To create a basic video player, an application can create a
 * #GstPipeline as normal using gst_pipeline_new() and set the
 * sink on it to one created with cogl_gst_video_sink_new(). The
 * application can then listen for the #CoglGstVideoSink::new-frame
 * signal which will be emitted whenever there are new textures ready
 * for rendering. For simple rendering, the application can just call
 * cogl_gst_video_sink_get_pipeline() in the signal handler and use
 * the returned pipeline to paint the new frame.
 *
 * An application is also free to do more advanced rendering by
 * customizing the pipeline. In that case it should listen for the
 * #CoglGstVideoSink::pipeline-ready signal which will be emitted as
 * soon as the sink has determined enough information about the video
 * to know how it should be rendered. In the handler for this signal,
 * the application can either make modifications to a copy of the
 * pipeline returned by cogl_gst_video_sink_get_pipeline() or it can
 * create its own pipeline from scratch and ask the sink to configure
 * it with cogl_gst_video_sink_setup_pipeline(). If a custom pipeline
 * is created using one of these methods then the application should
 * call cogl_gst_video_sink_attach_frame() on the pipeline before
 * rendering in order to update the textures on the pipeline's layers.
 *
 * If the %COGL_FEATURE_ID_GLSL feature is available then the pipeline
 * used by the sink will have a shader snippet with a function in it
 * called cogl_gst_sample_video0 which takes a single vec2 argument.
 * This can be used by custom snippets set the by the application to
 * sample from the video. The vec2 argument represents the normalised
 * coordinates within the video. The function returns a vec4
 * containing a pre-multiplied RGBA color of the pixel within the
 * video.
